# Distributed and Parallel Technologies coursework

## Your coursework project

Your fork of this project will be the code part of your coursework
submission for F20DP/F21DP.

Here are the instructions for your code submission.

1. One student in your coursework group should __fork__ this
   project. __Do not rename the project__ when forking it.
2. That student should then add their coursework partner as a
    _Developer_ member of that GitLab project on the website by going
    to: _Settings_ then _Members_ on your forked project.
3. Include the URL of your project fork to the GitLab project in your
   PDF report being submitted on Canvas.

## Project structure

Create two separate directories in your project, one for each of the
two programming language technologies that you and your coursework
partner(s) are evaluating. Each member of your group should work
within their respective directory.

## What to add to your project

You should `git add` anything to your project that is required to
build your code, e.g. a `Makefile`, in addition to your source code.

Your code must be compilable and runnable on the Robotarium cluster
for your code to be awarded any marks.

## What not to add to your project

Git is for version controlling plain text files, e.g. source code
files. Do not add to your project any binary files, e.g. PDF files or
executable files, because git cannot version control them and they
would only serve to bloat your git repository.

To ensure you do not accidentally add binary files to your project,
add their file names to the `.gitignore` file at the top level of your
project fork.
